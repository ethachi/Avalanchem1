# Contract

This is simple code used to explain the require,assert and revert statements.


## Description

The Solidity smart contract titled func features three distinct functions: Require(), Revert(), and Assert(). Each function employs a specific error-handling mechanism. The Require() function utilizes the require() statement to validate that the value of z exceeds zero; failure to meet this condition results in an error. In contrast, the Revert() function checks whether the sum of x and y surpasses 10, throwing an error if this condition is not met. Finally, the Assert() function relies on the assert() statement to confirm if n is greater than zero before executing a division operation by c, terminating with an error if this requirement is not fulfilled.


## Requirements

To use this contract, you will need a Solidity development environment, such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat. You will also need a test network or a local blockchain to deploy and test the contract.
## Usage

To use this contract, follow these steps:

1)Open the Solidity development environment of your choice and create a new file.

2)Copy and paste the contents of Contract.sol into your file.

3)Compile the contract to check for any errors or warnings.

4)Deploy the contract to a test network or a local blockchain.

5)Call the setValue function with a uint256 value as an argument.

6)Check that the value variable has been set correctly by reading its value.
